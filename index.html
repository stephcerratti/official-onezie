        Hailing from Caledonia, Ontario (just outside of Hamilton) Brenden got his
        start as Onez!e almost three years ago. It wasn't easy for a once hardcore
        music fan to transition into the electronic scene, and those who have been
        following him from the beginning will have noticed the many changes in his
        productions as he tried to find his "sound".<br />
        <br />
        After lots of trial and error, he achieved what he was looking for: blissful
        and melodic progressive with subtle dark undertones. He doesn't stop there
        either! Onez!e is such a dynamic producer and draws from many different
        electronic music styles and always has at least three tracks on the go at
        once. Onez!e is also quite a talented DJ. He has spun all over Hamilton and
        is finally breaking into the difficult Toronto scene also.
